## Built Projects

### Frontend Projects
[Leonwell](https://leonwell.vercel.app/) - The Leonwell website was built using Astro.js and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases the powerful combination of Astro.js, a modern static site generator, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The website aims to provide an elegant and performant user experience while highlighting the capabilities of these technologies. [Github page](https://github.com/SeanoChang/leonwell)

### Python Projects
[Data Mining Project](https://github.com/SeanoChang/ece49595_final_project) - Running through LSTM, random forest, and linear regression to fit models for price prediction accuracy under different market conditions, up trends, down trends, and sideways.

### C/C++ Projects
[Shortest Path Finder](https://github.com/SeanoChang/shortest_path) - Given the dimension and the values of each cell in a grid and reconstruct the path with a graph structure. This program went through the grid from the top row to the bottom row and found the shortest time for each entry to reach the bottom row using priority queue. Among all the paths, the program found the path with the shortest time to exit the grid.

[Huffam Decoding](https://github.com/SeanoChang/huffam_decoding) - Decoded the Huffman tree and turned the encoded file into human-readable text using stacks and binary trees.

[Simple Assembly Decoder](https://github.com/SeanoChang/ece39595_project) - Provided a simple assembly code (within 50 lines), the program parsed the code and generated the corresponding machine code with the help of a symbol table, instruction buffer, and string buffer. The virtual machine in the program reads the machine code and executes the code.
