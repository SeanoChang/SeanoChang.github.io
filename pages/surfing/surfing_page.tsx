                            Started surfing when I was at the first year of college. Although, due to covid, I hadn&rsquo;t been able to travel to the state,
                            I met some great friend through a program for international students in TsinHua University. One day, someone had an idea
                            to take a trip to Yilan for surfing, and with the thought of giving surfing a try, I went with them.

                            The first time I went to surf, I had such a great time. The condition of the wave was so good and beginner friendly, and 
                            I was able to catch a lot of waves. I could recall the first time I stood up from the surfboard and the feeling of the speed,
                            the wind, and the water. At that moment, I knew that I was going to addicted to surfing.

                            In the next summer, I went to do an part&ndash;time coach in Pirate Surf, which is one of the local surf shop in Yilan, Taiwan, 
                            and I was able to teach some beginners how to surf. Got immersed in the surfing vibe and the community of surfing, I was able
                            to meet a lot of great local surfers and learn from them. Gradually, I was able improve my surfing techniques a lot.

                            After I went to the US, due to my school&rsquo;s location, I wasn&rsquo;t able to surf at all. However, my friends and I took a trip to 
                            California and we went surfing in the great Huntington Beach, aka the Surf City. I even bought my first shortboard, which is a SharpEye storm, 
                            at Huntington Beach. However shortboard surfing is a lot harder than longboard surfing, so I didn&rsquo;t manage to surf a single wave during
                            the trip in Orange County.

                            Summer 2022, I went back to Yilan and I start to surf with smaller wave conditions. The gentler wave allowed me to practice catching waves
                            since we had to paddle a lot lol, also that I could practice my surfing techniques without the fear of getting hurt. I improved so much during
                            the one month stay in Yilan.
