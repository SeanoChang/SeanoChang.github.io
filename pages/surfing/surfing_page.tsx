                            Started surfing when I was at the first year of college. Due to covid, I hadn't been able to travel to the state.
                            However, I met some friends through the a program from a college in Taiwan and we went to surf on one weekend.

                            The first time I went to surf, I had such a great time. The condition of the wave was so good and beginner friendly, and 
                            I was able to catch a lot of waves. I could recall the first time I stood up from the surfboard and the feeling of the speed,
                            the wind, and the water. At that moment, I knew that I was going to addicted to surfing.

                            In the next summer, I went to do an part-time coach in Pirate Surf, which is one of the local surf shop in Yilan, Taiwan, 
                            and I was able to teach some beginners how to surf. Got immersed in the surfing vibe and the community of surfing, I was able
                            to meet a lot of great local surfers and learn from them. Gradually, I was able improve my surfing techniques a lot.

                            After I went to the US, due to my school's location, I wan't able to surf at all. However, my friends and I took a trip to 
                            California and we went surfing in the great Huntington Beach, aka the Surf City. I even bought my first board and first shortboard, 
                            which was a SharpEye storm. However shortboard surfing is a lot harder than longboard surfing, so I didn't manage to surf a single wave.

                            Summer 2022, I went back to Yilan and I start to surf with smaller wave conditions. The gentler wave allowed me to practice catching waves
                            since we had to paddle a lot lol, also that I could practice my surfing techniques without the fear of getting hurt. I improved so much during
                            the one month stay in Yilan.
